A widget is an extension that displays a small amount of timely, useful information or app-specific functionality. For example, the News widget shows top headlines. Calendar provides two widgets, one that shows today’s events and one that shows what’s up next. Notes lets you preview recent notes and quickly create new notes, reminders, photos, and drawings. Widgets are highly customizable and can contain buttons, text, layout customizations, images, and more.
